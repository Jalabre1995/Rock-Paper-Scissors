# Rock-Paper-Scissors

The purpose of this application is to create a fun rock-paper scissors game to play with a CPU. What you will see in this repository is a index.html file, style.css file,and a script.js file. The application is very simple and easy to use. There will be three icons displayed in the middel fo the scrren. Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Press start and make the first move against the CPU. 

# Challenges
The issue that I am having currently with this application is that the userchoice is not being converted into inner.html. It says in the console that I can't make that property null. So that is being figured out for the time being.
